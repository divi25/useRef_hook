Step 1
: Create a new React app using CRA
npx create-react-app myapp//command is used
Step 2: Install Cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
Step 3: Create a simple React app using useRef hook
Step 4: Write test cases in Cypress

cy.get('p').should('have.text', 'Count: 0');
This will make the test case fail because the count value is no longer being updated.
After we have removed the useRef hook, we need to update 
the test case in cypress/integration/counter.spec.js to make it fail
